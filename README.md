# Squares-Versus-Circles
A game where we play one of the squares and try to beat the circles

# Game Explanation
Join the relentless battle between squares and circles as a square, and destroy the opposing circles' base as if you were fighting with weapons.
In total, there are 4 different types of friends and 4 different types of enemies, and each has its own attack and other tactics.
We have our own bases and outposts, and so do our enemies.
Our goal is to keep spawning and fend off the circles coming towards us.

# Controls
w,a,s,d or arrow keys to movement
Left Shift to move fast
Fire1 to attack
Space to increase our special power

# What I really want to do with algorithms
For Friends

Algorithm type: Euclidean distance check

Algorithm type: Time-based event control (Temporal Control)

Algorithm type: Vector normalization + linear motion

Algorithm type: Layer Mask + Trigger Collision

For Enemies

Algorithm type: State machines (Finite State Logic – simple)

Algorithm type: Physics engine + force vector

Algorithm type: Constrained optimization

Algorithm type: List-based resource management
